What is this?

These are virtual machine base images used by the Shaken Fist
cloud orchestrator (shakenfist.com). Each should run equally
well on OpenStack, native KVM, or a variety of other hypervisors
with the exception that these all have the Shaken Fist guest
agent baked into them. That's ok for other locations, but each
to their own.

The current options are:

* centos: 7, 8-stream (current default for "centos"), 9-stream
  (work in progress).
* debian: 10, 11 (current default for "debian"), 12 (work in
  progress).
* debian-docker: 11. This is a version of debian 11 with docker
  pre-installed for convenience.
* debian-gnome: 11. This is a version of debian 11 with the gnome
  desktop pre-installed for convenience.
* debian:xfce: 11. This is a version of debian 11 with the XFCE
  desktop pre-installed for convenience.
* ubuntu: 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04 (current default for
  "ubuntu").

In each directory is a latest.qcow2, which points to... the
most recent version of each image.
