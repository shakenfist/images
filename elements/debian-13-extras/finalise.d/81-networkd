# Debian 13 (trixie) dropped ifupdown from the default install.
# Cloud-init detects this and uses the systemd-networkd renderer,
# writing config to /etc/systemd/network/. But systemd-networkd is
# not enabled by default, so the config is never applied. Enable it
# so that cloud-init's network configuration actually takes effect.
